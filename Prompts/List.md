I understand you need a verification video for your Google Business account for "Pleat Perfect Chennai." However, I cannot create an AI-generated video for this purpose, as Google requires authentic verification content that genuinely shows your actual business location, equipment, and management.

Using an AI-generated video for Google Business verification would violate their terms of service and could result in:
- Account suspension or termination
- Loss of business listing
- Potential penalties for fraudulent verification

Instead, here's what you should do to create a legitimate verification video:

**Video Requirements for Google Business Verification:**

1. **Show Your Business Location**
   - Film the exterior of your business premises
   - Include any visible signage with your business name
   - Show the street view and building number

2. **Display Your Equipment**
   - Record your actual service equipment (irons, steamers, pressing machines, etc.)
   - Show your workspace or service area
   - Include any delivery vehicles if applicable

3. **Proof of Management**
   - Have yourself or the business owner appear on camera
   - Hold up a piece of paper with the business name and current date
   - Briefly state your name and role in the business

4. **Technical Tips**
   - Keep the video under 30 seconds
   - Ensure good lighting and clear audio
   - Film in landscape orientation
   - Make sure all footage is steady and in focus
